This application is to use what you have learned to produce a fairly complex program. It involves version control, unit testing, the use of design patterns and automatic documentation generation. The idea of the program is to produce a simplified environment for teaching simple programming concepts. You are to create a simple programming language that has the basics of sequence, selection and iteration and allows a student programmer to explore them using graphics.
