This application is to use what you have learned to produce a fairly complex program. It involves version control, unit testing, the use of design patterns and automatic documentation generation. The idea of the program is to produce a simplified environment for teaching simple programming concepts. You are to create a simple programming language that has the basics of sequence, selection and iteration and allows a student programmer to explore them using graphics.

FOR BASIC COMMAND
DrawTo x,y 
Circle <radius>
Rectangle <width>, <height>
Triangle <base>, <adj>, <hyp>,<base>, <adj>, <hyp>
Polygon  <base>, <adj>, <hyp>,<base>, <adj>, <hyp>,<base>, <adj>

//if single lne
loop n
drawto x y
circl radius
if counter = n then radius + size
endloop;

//if block
Loop n 
drawto x y
circl radius
IF counter = 4
radius + 10
Endif
endloop

//repeat
drawto 33 44
rectangle 44 55
repeat 4 rectangle + 4
